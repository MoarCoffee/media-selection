# Book recommendations
A bit of preface so you can judge if my taste is something you should care about: I tend to flip-flop between Sci-fi and Fantasy. I find Brandon Sanderson's books a mixed bag because they have great internal consistency but his way of writing characters is too bland for me. The Kingkiller Chronicle starts really promising but I couldn't even finish the second book. I also never managed to finish the Wheel of Time series. Gotten to book 6 a number of times but then my desire to live takes over and I just abandon the effort.

## Some modern fantasy recommendations, all with good audio book productions
- The First Law series by Joe Abercrombie. Amazing characters, amazing world building. 
- Shadows of the Apt series by Adrian Tchaikovsky. Very cool world concept. Story carries well for the entire 10+ books. 
- The Powder Mage trilogy by Brian McClellan. Gun powder-based magic. 'nuff said. 
- The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch. Heist story in fantasy setting. It’s really a trilogy but I say stick to the first book. Scott went through some rough times during the writing of the 2nd and never really got back on track. 
- Throne of the Crescent Moon by Saladin Ahmed. Middle-Eastern fantasy, feels like a good fresh alternative to all the Tolkien-eske stuff.
- A Land Fit For Heroes series by Richard K. Morgan. Not for everybody but definitely for people who like Altered Carbon. 
- The Divine Cities trilogy by Robert Jackson Bennett. Fantasy in a world on the verge of modernization. Great characters, some unusual PoV choices.
- Anansi boys by Neil Gaiman. I don't normally find Gaiman amazing, but this book is one of his better works. An almost self contained novel (does have some relation to American Gods).
- The Magicians series by Lev Grossman. A dark take on the "Narnia-idea". It definitely helps to have read some of the Narnia books first.
- Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin. Long before there was Harry Potter, there was a good book about a young wizard who grows up to save the world. I read this book once per day for a week when I first discovered it.
- Dune by Frank Herbert. Amazing book, very poor Audible adaptation.
- Clocktaur War series, by T. Kingfisher. A cozy series about magic, or actually the tale of three very interesting characters with an accompanying backdrop story about magic. Very nicely read by Khristine Hvam too. If you like this one you should read "A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking" too.
- The Golem and the Jinni by Helen Wecker. A story about two magical beings arriving to eary 20-century New York.

## Just for balance, a selection of sci-fi recommendations too
- The Murder Bot Diaries by Martha Wells. Love this series, can’t recommend it enough. 
- Takeshi Kovacs series by Richard K. Morgan. 
- The Quantum Evolution series by Derek Künsken. Starts off as a heist story, but so many interesting takes on post-humanity. Some really scary too.
- The Quantum Thief by Hannu Rajaniemi. Not related to the above series at all. Probably the hardest sci-fi book I’ve read. Fair warning though, you will enjoy it more if you know some grad level maths and cryptography. 
- Blindsight by Peter Watts. Amazing philosophical book about life and consciousness. Also, it has scientifically realistic vampires. In space. 
- Red Rising Saga by Pierce Brown. A space opera style story. Somewhat bleak at times, but good characters and seems to just keep on going.
- Machine Man by Max Barry. Something of a cautionary tale / commedy about body augmentation.
- The Silo Saga by Hugh Howey. Though the TV-series adaptation is very good, the books cover so much more. A very compelling take on the apocalypse.


## And finally some that fit into either category
- The Locked Tomb Trilogy by Tamsyn Muir. A series about young necromancers, in space. Some adolescent angst warning, but it's so weird that it almost isn't noticeable.
- All books by Peter Clines, just read them all. Start with 14 tho. Can't say anything else, because it will spoil the amazing writing.
- The Broken Earth series, by N.K. Jemesin. Amazing writing and story, though sometimes a bit hard to parse because of the changing perspectives. But do read it.
