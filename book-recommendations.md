# Book recommendations
A bit of preface so you can judge if my taste is something you should care about: I tend to flip-flop between Sci-fi and Fantasy. I find Brandon Sanderson's books a mixed bag because they have great internal consistency but his way of writing characters is too bland for me. The Kingkiller Chronicle starts really promising but I couldn't even finish the second book. I also never managed to finish the Wheel of Time series. Gotten to book 6 a number of times but then my desire to live takes over and I just abandon the effort.

## Some modern fantasy recommendations, all with good audio book productions
- The First Law series by Joe Abercrombie. Amazing characters, amazing world building. 
- Shadows of the Apt series by Adrian Tchaikovsky. Very cool world concept. Story carries well for the entire 10+ books. 
- The Powder Mage trilogy by Brian McClellan. Gun powder-based magic. 'nuff said. 
- The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch. Heist story in fantasy setting. It’s really a trilogy but I say stick to the first book. Scott went through some rough times during the writing of the 2nd and never really got back on track. 
- Throne of the Crescent Moon by Saladin Ahmed. Middle-Eastern fantasy, feels like a good fresh alternative to all the Tolkien-eske stuff.
- A Land Fit For Heroes series by Richard K. Morgan. Not for everybody but definitely for people who like Altered Carbon. 
- The Divine Cities trilogy by Robert Jackson Bennett. Fantasy in a world on the verge of modernization. Great characters, some unusual PoV choices. 

## Just for balance, a selection of sci-fi recommendations too
- The Murder Bot Diaries by Martha Wells. Love this series, can’t recommend it enough. 
- Takeshi Kovacs series by Richard K. Morgan. 
- The Quantum Evolution series by Derek Künsken. Starts off as a heist story, but so many interesting takes on post-humanity. Some really scary too.
- The Quantum Thief by Hannu Rajaniemi. Not related to the above series at all. Probably the hardest sci-fi book I’ve read. Fair warning though, you will enjoy it more if you know some grad level maths and cryptography. 
- Blindsight by Peter Watts. Amazing philosophical book about life and consciousness. Also, it has scientifically realistic vampires. In space. 
- Red Rising series by Pierce Brown. A space opera style story. Somewhat bleak at times, but good characters and seems to just keep on going.
